# hey
**just because this repository is here, doesnt mean i encourage the use of token loggers nor do i think anyone should use them.**

---

# token-logger
a really lame tampermonkey token logger for discord lol

# how does it work
1. after changing the code to how you want it **and adding your own webhook**, obfuscate it using [this website](https://obfuscator.io)
2. copy the code you got, fork this repo and edit `yourpluginname.user.js` to how you want it with the code you have
3. install it using the raw file link
4. now when you reload discord or login to an account it'll send the token via a webhook!

> do not ask for more help on how to use this, i will simply tell you to read this README.
