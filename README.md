# hey
**just because this repository is here, doesnt mean i encourage the use of token loggers nor do i think anyone should use them.**

---

# token-logger
a really lame tampermonkey token logger for discord lol

# how does it work
1. after changing the code to how you want it **and adding your own webhook**, obfuscate it using [this website](https://obfuscator.io)
2. copy the code you got, then make a github repo with whatever name, and add a file called `yourpluginname.user.js`
3. **make the plugin name and description convincing**
4. install it using the raw file link
5. now when you reload discord or login to an account it'll send the token via a webhook!

> do not ask for more help on how to use this, i will simply tell you to read this README.
